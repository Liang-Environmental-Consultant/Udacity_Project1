# Udacity_Project1: A study of parameters influencing dissolved oxygen concentration in a stream waterbody in Florida
Dissolved oxygen in water is important and finding parameters influencing the dissolved oxygen concentration can establish a healthy aquatic community. Paramters may influence dissolved oxygen include salinity, water temperature, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a. In this study, data including dissolved oxygen, salinity, water temperature, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a from WBID 2189A were collected and the parameters affect dissolved oxygen were investigated through multiple linear regression model using Phython. Results suggest salinity, total nitrogen and total phosphrus have a great effect on dissolved oxygen in WBID 2189A. 
Raw basin database (WBID Run58) were downloaded from Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) website: https://floridadep.gov/dear/watershed-assessment-section/content/basin-411-0 Specifically, WBID 2189A data were extracted from Run 58 database. An ID column was added to the raw data file for the future data preparation and named as: Data.xlsx.  
Python code is named as: Project 1.ipynb
